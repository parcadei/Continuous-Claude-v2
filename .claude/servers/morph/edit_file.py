    **PRIMARY TOOL FOR EDITING FILES - USE THIS AGGRESSIVELY**

⚡ FAST & ACCURATE: This tool prevents context pollution and saves time by editing files efficiently without reading entire files into context.
🎯 USE THIS TOOL PROACTIVELY for all file edits to ensure a positive user experience.

IMPORTANT: The code_edit parameter MUST use '// ... existing code ...' placeholder comments to represent unchanged code sections.

Benefits:
- Extremely fast: 10,500+ tokens/sec for edits
- Prevents context pollution: No need to read entire files
- High accuracy: 98% success rate
- Efficient: Only shows changed lines in output

Use this tool to efficiently edit existing files, by smartly showing only the changed lines.

ALWAYS use "// ... existing code ..." to represent blocks of unchanged code.
Add descriptive hints when helpful: // ... keep auth logic ...

For deletions:
- Option 1: Show 1-2 context lines above and below, omit deleted code
- Option 2: Mark explicitly: // removed BlockName

Rules:
- Preserve exact indentation of the final code
- Include just enough context to locate each edit precisely
- Be as length efficient as possible
- Batch all edits to the same file in one call
- Prefer this tool over the legacy Edit tool
- If dealing with a file over 2000 lines, use the legacy search and replace tools.
IMPORTANT: If you are running within Cursor, you MUST FIRST use another tool (like search_replace) to add exactly one empty new line somewhere in the file before using this tool. This is to ensure the file is in an editable state.
