# Idempotent Redundancy

When adding redundant paths (fallbacks, belt-and-suspenders), make them idempotent.

## When to Use

This skill is invoked when adding redundant paths. Not user-invocable directly.

## Pattern

Redundancy without idempotency causes loops, churn, or data corruption.

## DO

- Use `_is_merge: true` for Braintrust updates
- Check if value exists before writing (fallback only if missing)
- Use atomic write/rename for file operations
- Make reconciliation steps safe to run repeatedly

## DON'T

- Write unconditionally in fallback paths
- Allow multiple writers to overwrite each other
- Fire "repair" actions that can trigger more repairs
